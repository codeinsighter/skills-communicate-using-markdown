# Learning Markdown: how to make you understand in simple and productive terms.




## Let us dive deep in this world to showcase some codes with colours and highlights:

``` c++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int n=5; //initializing a variable with type 'int'
    for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
        for(int k=0; k<n; k++){
            cout<<"*";
        }
        cout<<endl;
    }
}
```

This is a simple code to print a basic pattern with *'s drawing out what you call rectangle or a square!
